# Hackathon-Drawing-App

## Mintbean.io Junior Developer Hackathon

## Challenge Introduction

[Hackathon Brief](https://mintbean.io/meets/cfa4fa54-c706-4c51-a04f-671f6686f9fd/resources)

Build an app that lets people express their creativity in a visual format. You can build ANY application you'd like. Whether it's a blank canvas that you can paint on, a photo-editing app, a shared white board -- as long as it fulfills one OR both of the following requirements:

-   As a user, I can drag my mouse across the screen to make free-form lines.
-   As a user, I can click areas of the screen with my mouse to fill them with a color, texture or pattern.

## Approach

We are both front-end developers at the time of this hackathon. Our team approached this by setting a list of features we wanted to accomplish and working on each item one by one. We worked in one single repository and continously branched from our main when building features out. Once completed, we would add, commit and push on to the branch we were working on and review each others code prior to merge. Although we were unable to fully reach our desired goal, we are happy with the final product as we were able to implement most of our planned features.

## Motivation & Reflection

### Michael Tran

My motivation in participating in this hackathon was more for the experience working on a project with another developer. Grateful for the opportunity as it pushed me to learn new things and apply the knowledge I have gained so far in my developer journey. The highlight for me was knowing that I can read and understand another developers logic in approaching a problem and their solution. This also gave me really good practice in refactoring to get both of our code working efficiently together.

### Yehan Nilanga

My main motivation in participating was to gain more development experience outside of my personal projects. The knowledge I gained on working on a team, using Github and and utilizing the Canvas API will be helpful for my future projects.
