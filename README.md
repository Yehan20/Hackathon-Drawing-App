## Challenge Introduction

Build an app that lets people express their creativity in a visual format. You can build ANY application you'd like. Whether it's a blank canvas that you can paint on, a photo-editing app, a shared white board -- as long as it fulfills one OR both of the following requirements:

-   As a user, I can drag my mouse across the screen to make free-form lines.
-   As a user, I can click areas of the screen with my mouse to fill them with a color, texture or pattern.
