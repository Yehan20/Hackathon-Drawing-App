# Hackerthron-Drawing-App

# Mintbean.io Junior Developer Hackathon

## Challenge Introduction

Build an app that lets people express their creativity in a visual format. You can build ANY application you'd like. Whether it's a blank canvas that you can paint on, a photo-editing app, a shared white board -- as long as it fulfills one OR both of the following requirements:

-   As a user, I can drag my mouse across the screen to make free-form lines.
-   As a user, I can click areas of the screen with my mouse to fill them with a color, texture or pattern.

## Motivation

### Michael

My motivation in participating in this Hackathon was more for the experience working on a project with another developer. Greatful for the opportunity as it pushed me to learn new things and apply the knowledge I have gained so far in my developer journey.

## Approach

Our team approached this by setting a list of features we wanted to accomplish and working on each item one by one. We worked in one single repository and continously branched from our main when building features out. Once completed, we would add, commit and push on to the branch we were working on and review each others code prior to merge. Although we were unable to fully reach our desired goal, we are happy with the final product as we were able to implement most of our planned features.
